# rbmetadata-go

Translation of the Rockbox metadata reader from C to Go.
Currently a work in progress.
See `todo.md` for what needs to be done.

Code is kept organized as closely as it can to the original source's code,
with the `.c` and `.h` extensions being added as `_c` or `_h` after the orginal file's name.
